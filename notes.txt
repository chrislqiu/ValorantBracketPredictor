 venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  <-- to activate venv to isolate packages

 Mistakes:
 - tried to push venv (LOL), put it in gitignore

What I did after:

pip install requests pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost <-- installing all the imports I need
    - requests for API
    - numpy to work with the data
    - scikit-learn lib for ML tools
- xgboost notes cause I've never used it before:
    * extreme gradient  boosting
    * combines multiple weak models to create stronger models
    * use errors on prev test to train next tree using regularization to prevent overfitting
    * repeat the process
    * sequential

Need Scraper to pull info from VLR.gg/matches/results
    - need team name and score (for now)
    - include other data like player composition (later)
